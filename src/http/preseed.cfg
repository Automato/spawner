# Disable that annoying WEP key dialog.
d-i netcfg/wireless_wep string

### Network console
# Use the following settings if you wish to make use of the network-console

### Partitioning

# The presently available methods are: "regular", "lvm" and "crypto"

# If one of the disks that are going to be automatically partitioned
# contains an old LVM configuration, the user will normally receive a
# warning. This can be preseeded away...
d-i partman-lvm/device_remove_lvm boolean true

# The same applies to pre-existing software RAID array:
d-i partman-md/device_remove_md boolean true

# Allowed values: none, safe-upgrade, full-upgrade
d-i pkgsel/upgrade select none

# Some versions of the installer can report back on what software you have
# installed, and what software you use. The default is not to report back,
# but sending reports helps the project determine what software is most
# popular and include it on CDs.

### Boot loader installation

# This is fairly safe to set, it makes grub install automatically to the MBR
# if no other operating system is detected on the machine.
d-i grub-installer/only_debian boolean true
# FIXME: are these related??
# This one makes grub-installer install to the MBR if it also finds some other
# OS, which is less safe as it might not be able to boot that other OS.
d-i grub-installer/with_other_os boolean true

### Finishing up the installation

# Avoid that last message about the install being complete.
d-i finish-install/reboot_in_progress note


#### Advanced options
### Running custom commands during the installation
# d-i preseeding is inherently not secure. Nothing in the installer checks
# for attempts at buffer overflows or other exploits of the values of a
# preconfiguration file like this one. Only use preconfiguration files from
# trusted locations! To drive that home, and because it's generally useful,
# here's a way to run any shell command you'd like inside the installer,
# automatically.

# This first command is run as early as possible, just after
# preseeding is read.
# Prevent packaged version of VirtualBox Guest Additions being installed:
d-i preseed/early_command string sed -i \
  '/in-target/idiscover(){/sbin/discover|grep -v VirtualBox;}' \
  /usr/lib/pre-pkgsel.d/20install-hwpackages
