## Purpose

Brood Mother is a piece of the Hatchery devops toolbox consisting of a number of tools, primarily Packer.
It uses packer and creates a working starting point and framework for building system images.
Brood Mother attempts to start from a generalized, agnostic viewpoint to offer developers the chance to substitute their preferred components easily.

## Use case

You want to use packer and work it into your devops pipeline, but setting it up requires you to make too many decisions up front.
